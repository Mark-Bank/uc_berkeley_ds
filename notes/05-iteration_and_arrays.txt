While loop
  - the body is executed repeatedly, until the condition is no longer satisfied
  - the condition is more formally called the "loop condition" (& body "loop body")


For loop
  - syntax: for(initialize; test; next) { statements; }
  - the structure helps clarify the loop's logic


Arrays
  - every array is an object consisting of an indexed list of variables
  - each numbered variable can be a primitive type or a reference
  - in memory e.g.
             0 1 2 3
    c[-]--->[b|l|u|e]

  - syntax
    char[] c;           //reference to array (any length) of chars
    c = new char[4];    //woo!
    c[0] = 'b';
    c[3] = 'e';
    c[4] = 's';         //Java's going to be angry when it sees what you've done
                        // runtime error - array index out of bounds exception

    * char c[]; is also a valid declaration. those brackets can go both ways

  - c.length - field indicating length of array (read-only; writing to it -> compile-time error)


Multi-dimensional arrays

  - 2 dimensional: an array of references to arrays
