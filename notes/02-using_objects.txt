Objects and Methods

  $ String s1 = "Yow!"; // s1[-]--->[Yow!]
                        // (syntactic sugar: combine declaration and assignment)

  $ String s2 = s1;     // s1[-]--->[Yow!]<---[-]s2
                        // s1 and s2 reference the same object

  $ s2 = new String(s1); // s1[-]--->[Yow!] s2[-]--->[Yow!]
                         // copy constructor enables s1 and s2 to ref. dif. objs w/ same data

  - Strings are immutable

  - constructors

    - new String() constructs empty string (contains no characters)
    - "whatever" constructs string containing the characters in the quote
    - new String(str) takes an argument, str, and copies the chars contained in str

    - constructors always have the same name as their class (except for data enclosed in quotes, where Java Strings those)
    - constructors (except for quote data) always require the 'new' keyword

  $ s2 = s1.toUppercase(); // s2[-]--->[YOW!]

  $ s3 = s2.concat("!!");  // s3[-]--->[YOW!!!]
  $ s3 = s2 + "!!";        // java implicitly calls concat()

  $ s4 = "*".concat(s2).concat("*");

Java I/O Classes

  - Objects in System class interact with a user

  - System.out is a PrintStream object that outputs to the screen
  - System.in is an InputStream object that reads from the keyboard
    - These statements are actually shorthand for "System.blah is a variable that references an xStream object"

  - readLine method is defined for BufferedReader objects


  - to construct a BufferedReader, construct an InputStreamReader
  - to construct an InputStreamReader, construct an InputStream
  - to construct an InputStream, System.in is one!

  - InputStream reads raw bitstreams
  - InputStreamReader composes those bitstreams into characters (typ. 2 bytes long)
  - BufferedReader composes those characters into entire lines of text

  - this composure is based on modularity (separate objects for each logical step, so they are flexible to internal/external change)

Sample program:

import java.io.*;

class SimpleIO {
  public static void main(String[] arg) throws IOException {
    BufferedReader keyboard = new BufferedReader(
      new InputStreamReader(System.in));
    System.out.println(keyboard.readLine());
  }
}

//end program

  - to use Java libraries other than java.lang, you must import them
  - a Java program always begins at a method called main
