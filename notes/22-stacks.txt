Stacks

  - operations

    1 push an item onto its top   'push'

    2 pop an item off of its top  'pop'   (returns that item)

    3 examine its top item        'top'   (like pop, but still on stack)


    - all should be O(1) time

  - impl simply via singly-linked list


  - stacks' simplicity can play in their favor
    - leading to easier debugging
    - leading to better understanding of the algorithm they're being used in
      e.g. "I have an algo that checks if parentheses match..."
        - "and it uses a list"  -> ???
        - "and it uses a stack" -> impl much clearer
